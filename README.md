Anti-Spam Email Project Description
This project tackles the ever-growing problem of spam emails by developing a system to identify and filter unwanted messages.

Function:

Analyzes incoming emails to classify them as spam or legitimate.
Leverages various techniques (depending on your implementation):
Rule-based filtering: Checks for common spam attributes like suspicious sender addresses, keywords in subject lines or content, and excessive use of ALL CAPS.
Statistical filtering: Analyzes email characteristics like word frequency and compares them to known spam patterns.
Machine learning models (optional): Trains a model on labeled datasets (spam/ham) to automatically classify new emails.
Benefits:

Improves email inbox organization and productivity by reducing spam clutter.
Protects users from phishing attempts and malicious content often found in spam emails.
